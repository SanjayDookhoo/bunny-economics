## 📖 About the Game

Bunny Economics was created for **Hack the System**, a civic and economic tech hackathon.  
It’s a lighthearted game where you play as a curious bunny hopping across bells to collect points.

When you fall, your score is compared to your previous run:  
- **Do better** → the economy is “blessed” with humorous news of growth.  
- **Do worse** → playful headlines reveal challenges like tariffs, recessions, or carrot shortages.  
- **Land in the middle** → stability!  

Economics can feel distant or intimidating. Bunny Economics makes it approachable and fun. Instead of graphs and jargon, players see cause and effect through whimsical headlines and outcomes.

## 💡 Challenges

I honestly thought I would be able to animate the bunny a lot better than I did.  
I ended up falling back to a sprite sheet for each frame animation is *very difficult* when you’re trying it for the first time.

---

## 🪞 Reflections

There are many things I would have changed if I had more time.  
I cut back on features that would have improved gameplay due to the limited timeline.  

The greatest reflection: partnering with someone more experienced in animation would have allowed the game to shine a lot more, especially since the bunny is the central part of the game.

## 🔮 Next Steps

- Add addictive and rewarding gameplay features, such as **collectible bonuses** that randomly spawn.  
- Instead of simple precompiled headlines, add persistence of state (tracking **labor force, tariffs, inflation, etc.**) to better showcase how these changes connect to economic concepts.

## 🌍 Vision

By disguising learning as laughter, Bunny Economics encourages players of all backgrounds to engage with civic and economic systems.  

Every hop is both a game and a lesson—showing that even small steps can shift the economy (and maybe the world) toward prosperity.
