		<h2>About the Game</h2>
		<p>
			<strong>Bunny Economics</strong> was created for
			<em>Hack the System</em>, a civic and economic tech hackathon. It's a
			lighthearted game where you play as a curious bunny hopping across bells
			to collect points.
		</p>
		<p>
			When you fall, your score is compared to your previous run: do better and
			the economy is ‚Äúblessed‚Äù with humorous news of growth. Do worse, and
			playful headlines reveal challenges like tariffs, recessions, or carrot
			shortages. Sometimes you'll land right in the middle, stability!
		</p>

		<h2>Why It Matters</h2>
		<p>
			Economics can feel distant or intimidating.
			<em>Bunny Economics</em> makes it approachable and fun. Instead of graphs and
			jargon, players see cause and effect through playful headlines and outcomes.
		</p>
		<p>
			The game teaches important ideas, like labor expansion, productivity
			growth, and trade shocks, without pressure. Players keep hopping because
			it's fun, and they end up learning along the way.

		<h2>Our Vision</h2>
		<p>
			By disguising learning as laughter, <em>Bunny Economics</em> encourages players
			of all backgrounds to engage with civic and economic systems. Every hop is
			both a game and a lesson, showing that even small steps can shift the economy
			and maybe the world, toward prosperity.
